> Easily download data and metadata from the StatsWales API

![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/statswalespy)

statswalespy is a Python package for interacting with the [StatsWales](https://statswales.gov.wales/Catalogue) API,
including functions for downloading datasets, downloading metadata, and searching for datasets using key words.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install statswalespy.

```bash
pip install statswalespy
```

## How to download data and metadata

The code below extracts data about [aircraft movement at Cardiff
airport](https://statswales.gov.wales/Catalogue/Transport/Air/aircraftmovementsatcardiffairport-by-movementtype-year)
and the associated metadata.

``` python
from statswalespy.download_data import statswales_get_dataset, statswales_get_metadata

metadata = statswales_get_metadata("tran0003")

data = statswales_get_dataset("tran0003")

# Print out the data
print(str(data))
```

## How to search for datasets

You can also search for datasets based on key terms. For example, data on farming or agriculture can be searched using this code:

``` python
from statswalespy.search import statswales_search

farming_datasets = statswales_search(["farm*", "agri*"])

# Print out results
print(str(farming_datasets))
```

Any suggestions for changes or extra work to make the package better are welcome.
